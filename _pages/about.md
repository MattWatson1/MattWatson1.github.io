I am a fifth year mathematics PhD candidate at the University of Colorado at Boulder advised by [Sebastian Casalaina-Martin](https://math.colorado.edu/~sbc21/). My current research is related to Hodge theoretic constructions of moduli spaces. More precisely, I have been studying the singularities appearing on arithmetic ball quotients defined over the Eisenstein integers with the hope of showing when these spaces are of general type. I have recently become more interested in modular forms.

When I'm not doing math, I enjoy hiking, reading fantasy books, playing board games, and going to the [movies](https://letterboxd.com/wattmatson/).
